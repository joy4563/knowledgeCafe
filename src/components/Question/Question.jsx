                <p>1. Difference Between Props and State?</p>
                <p>
                    Ans: The state is owned locally, and the component itself
                    updates it. Props are owned and read only by a parent.

                <p>2. How does useState work?</p>
                <p>
                    Ans: useState is React Hook that allows you to add state to a
                    functional component. It returns an array with two values:
                    the current state and a function to update it.
                </p>

                <p>3. Purpose of useEffect other than fetching data?</p>
                <p>
                    Ans: The useEffect in react js allows to perform side effects
                    in your components. The react useEffect examples of side
                    effects include retrieving data, direct DOM updates, and
                    timers.

                <p>4. How Does React work?</p>
                <p>
                    Ans: ReactJS divides the UI into isolated reusable pieces of
                    code known as components. React components work similarly to
                    JavaScript functions as they accept arbitrary inputs called
                    properties or props.{" "}
